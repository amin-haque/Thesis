# Undergraduate Thesis: Atomistic Investigation of Crack Propagation and Parameterization of Cohesive Traction-Separation of Single Crystal Cobalt-Titanium Alloy
Objectives of this thesis are:
 1. To conduct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of crack propagation under mode-I loading
 across a range of temperatures to understand the fracture mechanism of Co-Ti
 2. To observe stress developments and lattice structure evolution during crack propagation at
 different temperatures
 3. To extract and develop a traction-separation law for cohesive zone modeling from molecular
 dynamics simulations, enabling the integration of atomistic insights into macroscopic
 fracture models
